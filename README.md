This is a demo of using Airtable to capture emails with a Next.js + Tailwind CSS app. 

The flow is
-> User enters email
-> email is added to Airtable
-> Admin page showing subscriber list is refreshed using On-Demand Revalidation

You can add an extra step in Airtable with an automation to send a confirmation email to the user that they are subscribed.
